The interaction with the exponent is a little weird; e.g. if you have exponent = 0, you'll dip into eight-byte deltas occasionally anyway (with the 2 bit varint addition). I noticed that Christian's timestamp doesn't do this, so wondering if you think it still makes sense now that we have varint and a timestamp exponent.",
