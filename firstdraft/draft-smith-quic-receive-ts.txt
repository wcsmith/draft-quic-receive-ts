         QUIC Extension for Reporting Packet Receive Timestamps
                   draft-smith-quic-receive-ts-latest

Abstract

   This document defines an extension to the QUIC transport protocol
   which adds support for reporting packet receive timestamps in QUIC
   ACK frames.

1.  Introduction

   The QUIC Transport Protocol [I-D.ietf-quic-transport] provides a
   secure, multiplexed connection for transmitting reliable streams of
   application data.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Specification

3.1.  Transport Parameters

   The use of the ACK_RECEIVE_TIMETSAMP frame extension is negotiated
   using two transport parameters:

   *  max_receive_timestamps_per_ack (TBD): a variable-length integer
      indicating that the endpoint would like to receive
      ACK_RECEIVE_TIMESTAMP frames from the peer containing no more than
      the given maximum number of receive timestamps.

      Upon receiving this parameter, the peer SHOULD send
      ACK_RECEIVE_TIMESTAMP frames instead of ACK frames if it is able
      and has receive timestamp information to send.  Each
      ACK_RECEIVE_TIMESTAMP frame sent MUST NOT contain more than the
      specified maximum number of receive timestamps.

   *  receive_timestamps_exponent (TBD): a variable-length integer
      indicating the exponent to be used when encoding and decoding
      timestamp delta? fields in each ACK_RECEIVE_TIMESTAMP frame.  If
      this value is absent, a default value of 0 is assumed (indicating
      microsecond precision).  Values above 20 are invalid.

3.2.  ACK_RECEIVE_TIMESTAMP Frames

   Receivers send ACK_RECEIVE_TIMESTAMP (TBD) frames in the place of
   regular ACK frames described in [I-D.ietf-quic-transport].  However,
   ACK_RECEIVE_TIMESTAMP frames contain additional fields to report
   packet receive timestamps to the peer that sent them.

   ACK frames are structured as shown in Figure 1:

   ACK_RECEIVE_TIMESTAMP Frame {
     // Regular fields of the ACK (0x02) frame:
     Type (i) = TBD
     Largest Acknowledged (i),
     ACK Delay (i),
     ACK Range Count (i),
     First ACK Range (i),
     ACK Range (..) ...,
     // New fields for the ACK_RECEIVE_TIMESTAMP (0x22) frame:
     Timestamp Range Count (i),
     Timestamp Range (..) ...,
   }

                Figure 1: ACK_RECEIVE_TIMESTAMP Frame Format

   The new fields contained in ACK_RECEIVE_TIMESTAMP frames relative to
   ACK frames are:

   TODO Describe

3.2.1.  Timestamp Ranges

   Each Timestamp Range consists of a gap indicating the first packet in
   the range, and a list of timestamp deltas indicating the successive
   difference between contiguous packet receive timestamps in the range.

   Timestamp Ranges are structured as shown in Figure 2:

   Timestamp Range {
     Gap (i),
     Timestamp Delta Count (i),
     Timestamp Delta (i) ...,
   }

   The fields that form each Timestamp Range are:
