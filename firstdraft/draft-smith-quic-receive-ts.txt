         QUIC Extension for Reporting Packet Receive Timestamps
                   draft-smith-quic-receive-ts-latest

Abstract

   This document defines an extension to the QUIC transport protocol
   which adds support for reporting packet receive timestamps in QUIC
   ACK frames.

1.  Introduction

   The QUIC Transport Protocol [I-D.ietf-quic-transport] provides a
   secure, multiplexed connection for transmitting reliable streams of
   application data.

   TODO Describe motivation for receive timestamps

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Specification

3.1.  Transport Parameters

   The use of the timestamp frame extension is negotiated using two
   transport parameters:

   *  enable_receive_timestamps (value=TBD)

   *  receive_timestamps_exponent (value=TBD)

3.1.1.  Enable Receive Timestamps

   The enable_receive_timestamps (value=TBD) parameter is an varint
   value indicating that the endpoint would like to receive, and/or is
   able to send, ACK_RECEIVE_TIMESTAMP frames.  The value of the
   parameter is one of the following:

     +=======+======================================================+
     | Value | Meaning                                              |
     +=======+======================================================+
     | 1     | I would like to receive ACK_RECEIVE_TIMESTAMP frames |
     +-------+------------------------------------------------------+
     | 2     | I am able to send ACK_RECEIVE_TIMESTAMP frames       |
     +-------+------------------------------------------------------+
     | 3     | I would like to receive ACK_RECEIVE_TIMESTAMP frames |
     |       | and I am able to send them.                          |
     +-------+------------------------------------------------------+

                                 Table 1

3.1.2.  Receive Timestamps Exponent

   The receive_timestamps_exponent (value=TBD) parameter is an integer
   value indicating the exponent to be used when decode the receive
   timestamp delta fields in the ACK_RECEIVE_TIMESTAMP frame.  If this
   value is absent, a default value of 0 is assumed (indicating
   microsecond precision).  Values above 20 are invalid.

3.2.  ACK_RECEIVE_TIMESTAMP Frames

   Receivers send ACK_RECEIVE_TIMESTAMP frames in the place of QUIC ACK
   frames as is described in [I-D.ietf-quic-transport], except
   ACK_RECEIVE_TIMESTAMP frames contain additional fields to report
   packet receive timestamps to the sender.

   ACK frames are structured as shown in Figure 1:

   ACK_RECEIVE_TIMESTAMP Frame {
     Type (i) = TBD
     Largest Acknowledged (i),
     ACK Delay (i),
     ACK Range Count (i),
     First ACK Range (i),
     ACK Range (..) ...,
     Timestamp Range Count (i),
     Timestamp Range (..) ...,
   }

                Figure 1: ACK_RECEIVE_TIMESTAMP Frame Format

   The new fields contained in ACK_RECEIVE_TIMESTAMP frames relative to
   ACK frames are:

   TODO Describe

3.2.1.  Timestamp Ranges

   Each Timestamp Range consists of a gap indicating the first packet in
   the range, and a list of timestamp deltas indicating the successive
   difference between contiguous packet receive timestamps in the range.

   Timestamp Ranges are structured as shown in Figure 2:

   Timestamp Range {
     Gap (i),
     Timestamp Delta Count (i),
     Timestamp Delta (i) ...,
   }

                      Figure 2: Timestamp Range Format

   The fields that form each Timestamp Range are:

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
